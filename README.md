i'm [axionbuster].

i'm working on a pure Haskell implementation of a Minecraft server called [mmm].

for that task, i'm creating my own nonblocking TCP\/IP programming library called [winasyncsocket] to get around a deficiency in the existing [network] library.
i'll resume work to `mmm` once that\'s completed.
